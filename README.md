*1: The sector size is 512bytes.  
*2: These file sizes may be different from the loader binary files generated by bitbake. Also, the size of these files may change in future versions. Check the size of each file on your PC.  
*3: These RAM areas are not fixed because these binaries are stored in the local memory.  

The following shows the procedure of this command with the binary file loader_1st_128kb.bin.
Note that the values of eMMC save sector and file size must be entered as **hexadecimal**.

## 4. How to build the RZ/V2MA flash writer

This chapter describes how to build the RZ/V2MA flash writer. The following commands should be executed in your work directory {$WORK} on your Host PC.

### 4.1. Prepare the compiler

Get the cross compiler for linaro.

Linaro toolchain:

```shell
$ cd $WORK
$ wget https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.3-2018.05/aarch64-elf/gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-x86_64_aarch64-elf.tar.xz
$ tar xvf gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-x86_64_aarch64-elf.tar.xz
```

### 4.2. Prepare the source code

Get the source code of the RZ/V2MA flash writer from this repository as follows.

```shell
cd $WORK
git clone -b rz_v2ma https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzg2_flash_writer.git rzv2ma_flash_writer
```

### 4.3. Build the RZ/V2MA flash writer

The RZ/V2MA flash writer will be built by the following command.

Linaro toolchain:

```shell
$ cd $WORK/rzv2ma_flash_writer
$ make -f makefile.linaro clean
$ CROSS_COMPILE=../gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-x86_64_aarch64-elf/bin/aarch64-elf- make -f makefile.linaro
```

### 4.4. Check the output file
The output image will be available in the following directory.

| Generated files | File name    | File stored path                            |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Flash writer    | B2_intSW.bin | $WORK/rzv2ma_flash_writer /AArch64_output |

## 5. How to run the RZ/V2MA flash writer
### Step.1 Equipment setting
Connect your PC and the target board via a serial to micro-USB cable.  
Start a terminal software on your PC. Set the configuration of terminal software is as follows and select the Standard COM port.  
| Baud rate  | Data bit | Parity bit | Stop bit | Flow control |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 115200bps  | 8bits    | none       | 1bit     | none         |

*Note: It is recommended to set the Transmit delay to 0. This will speed up the writing binary file process.*

### Step.2 Write the flash writer to the eMMC
Store the Flash writer binary (B2_intSW.bin) in a micro-SDHC Card that has 1 partition formatted with FAT32.  
Insert the micro-SD card into the micro-SD card slot on the RZ/V2MA Evaluation Kit.  
Set the Main SW2 on the RZ/V2MA Evaluation Kit is as the following table to change the board operation mode to "forced write mode".
| SW1 | SW2 | SW3 | SW4 |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| OFF | OFF | OFF | ON  |

Power on the RZ/V2MA Evaluation Kit.  
Start RZ/V2MA in forced write mode and write the Flash writer binary from the micro-SD card to eMMC.  
Check the lighting of Main LED 2.Note that if the LED is blinking, writing the Flash writer binary is failed.
After checking the LED, power off the RZ/V2MA Evaluation Kit.


### Step.3 Start the flash writer
Set the Main SW2 on the RZ/V2MA Evaluation Kit is as the following table to change the board operation mode to "normal mode".

| SW1 | SW2 | SW3 | SW4 |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| OFF | OFF | OFF | OFF |

Power on the RZ/V2MA Evaluation Kit. The following log will appear if RZ/V2MA starts in normal mode and run Flash writer successfully.  

```text
Flash writer for RZ/V2MA <version> <MM DD, YY>
>
```

### Step.4 Write loader binaries to eMMC with Flash writer
Please enter any key from the console to continue.  
For details on how to write to the eMMC, please refer to 3.2 Command specification.  
After completing the writing, turn off the board.

### Step.5 Confirm booting by the boot loader and U-boot
Power on the RZ/V2MA Evaluation Kit with the normal mode.
Run "env default -a" to load the U-Boot environment variables.
And then, confirm that the boot loader and U-boot run successfully.
